## Keywords

We made a commitment to try and use the keywords from a standard vocabulary from NASA called [GCMD
keywords](https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/KeywordViewer/). Quite often they don't have what we 
need, and in that case it's ok to invent our own, but then we should try and re-use the same 
keywords as much as we can instead of inventing unique ones for every data product we create. 
Basically, the recommendation is to first check if there is something close to what you want 
already. And in any case, please refrain from using long phrases as keywords, they are very likely
to be one-offs, and thus not very useful.
